Getting started üõ†Ô∏è
You need to have git installed on your system to modify this repo.

Fork this repo from the fork option on top of my GitHub repo.
After completing the fork, move to the copied repo in your account and copy the HTTPS link from the code option.
Now in the terminal of your system(in vs code or any third party terminal) cd over to the location where you want to store this project & write, git clone copied link
This would create a copy in your local system and link it to the forked repo.
Now open this project in your desirable IDE and in the terminal write npm i, this would install all the necessary npm packages.
You can write npm start in the terminal to open the project in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser. This page should reload when you make any changes.
You can browse the project and make changes according to your will.
